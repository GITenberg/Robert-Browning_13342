description: On the subject of Browning's work innumerable things have been said and
  remain to be said; of his life, considered as a narrative of facts, there is little
  or nothing to say. It was a lucid and public and yet quiet life, which culminated
  in one great dramatic test of character, and then fell back again into this union
  of quietude and publicity.
